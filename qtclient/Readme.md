Qt Cloud Services Todo Example
==============================

> Note: this example is currently experimental and requires advanced knowledge of Qt!

This is a small Todo application which uses the Node.js server. This app is simple client, which means that there is no any local database available.
So make sure that you have the internet connection available in your device.
